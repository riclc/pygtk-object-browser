Description
-----------

Just a very small application to help PyGTK programmers out there.
But it can be improved in a number of ways!


-----------
Installation
------------

There is no need to install anything.
Just run the "PyGtkObjectBrowser.py" file.

But please make sure that the "data" folder is in the same folder
where the python files are! (But it should be there already.)

Component Images
----------------

All images are either from Glade or done by myself. Just email me
if you want to know which is which :)

Anyway, I would like to know if you use some of the images I have
made. Just send me an email and I will be happy :P
