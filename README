Description
-----------

Just a very small application to help PyGTK programmers out there.
But it can be improved in a number of ways!

-----------
Installation
------------

There is no need to install anything. Just run the python file.
Make sure the "data" folder is in the same folder where the
python file is (it should be already).

All images are either from Glade or done by myself.
